# Wolbachia_Target_Enrichment

### 1. Overview
The goal of this project was to test our ability to explore the diversity of Wolbachia in natural populations through the use of custom Target Enrichment Sequencing protocols.
We did it by:  
   * Developing the enrichment kit targetting phylogenetically informative, functional, and special genes;
   * Testing the performance of the kit on metagenomic libraries prepared using DNA for insects hosting different Wolbachia supergroups;
   * Applying the kit to a collection of XXX libraries representing nearly all host COI genotype - Wolbachia COI genotype combinations in a community sample from NE Greenland
In this repository, we have gathered all details of computational and bioinformatic approaches used for the paper that describes this assay  
  
### 2. TE kit design  
... Here we will briefly describe how the kit was designed, and will provide all alignments and sequences ...  
  
  
### 3. [Validation of target enrichment performance: sample selection, laboratory steps, and analysis/visualization](validation/Performance_assessment_validation.md)
In this section, we describe how we have tested the performance of the kit on metagenomic libraries prepared using DNA for insects hosting different Wolbachia supergroups.   
Specifically, we explain the experimental design and present the samples; then we explain the laboratory steps; and finally, data analysis and visualization steps.

### 4. [The bioinformatic pipeline for sequence reconstruction from metagenomic or target enrichment data](bioinformatics/Sequence_reconstruction_pipeline.md)
Here, we explain steps for sequence reconstruction from metagenomic data.  
We provide tools, parameters, and analysis scripts.

### 5. [The application of bioinformatics workflows to Greenland insect community samples](Greenland_insects/Greenland_insect_processing.md)
In this section, we describe how the Target Enrichment kit was applied to a collection of XX diverse Wolbachia-hosting insects from Greenland.
We explain the sample selection procedure, provide sample metadata, scripts, and analysis results.
